  Chico State has an amazing gym to workout in called the Wildcat Recreation Center, better known as the WREC. I wanted to use this application to find a yoga group exercise session and list it as a favorite class. The application was easy enough to traverse. The **mapping** of the main page was amazingly easy to understand. Mapping is a technical term that means the relationship between two things. In this case the picture given to the group exercise option shows three people doing, what I assume to be, jumping jacks. Even if the mapping was not easy to understand, each of the options were named under the pictures. This made the mapping very **effective** for me to understand what to do. This means that the mapping did its job exactly how it was supposed to.
	
  Knowing what to choose to find for the yoga classes I tapped the group exercises icon. What was loaded on my screen was a list of group exercises for that day. It happened to be March 4th which was a Monday. I could see next to March 4th to be the next two days after. On the top of the screen, I could see a picture of a calendar, when tapped it brought up a full calendar that showed every day of the month. Only in the day-by-day view could I see what group exercises were scheduled. This is good though because there were so many kinds of group exercises that it would be impractical to have all of them viewed on a full calendar. I searched for a yoga group exercise session on Monday and only found a hatha yoga session. I wanted regular yoga, so I looked on Tuesday. At 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday there was a yoga class that I was able to attend so I tapped the arrow to the right that was on the same row.
	
  What got brought up was a description of what yoga is and how it positively affects my health, the upcoming times, what room it is in, and there was a star on the top right of the screen with "FAV" under it. The yoga page was very **satisfying** to see as it was detailed and showed the exact information I was looking for, the times there were yoga group exercise sessions. For the page to be satisfying meant it gave me a feeling of fulfillment as I saw what I was trying to find. On top of that there was an option on the top right to add yoga to my favorites. I hit the star on the top right, and it turned black. Now I did not know what happened after that and I did not know how to see my favorites so that made the experience a little frustrating. I knew that I had it in my favorites, but how do I get to my favorites? It would have been nice for the application to give me a quick rundown of my favorites or give me the option to go straight to them. I decided it was time to go back to the main page.
	
    On the main page there was an option that was a black star with the words "FAVORITE CLASSES" under it. I knew that was the exact option I was looking for, so I tapped it. What I came to was another calendar page that was exactly like the group exercises calendar page, except this time it only showed the yoga classes. This was not a **safe** choice, as the class that I care about will not be lost and is always easy to find. There was only one thing that I thought could make my favorite classes page even better. When I pressed the calendar icon on the top of the page the calendar was blank. Now I know on the group exercises calendar page I thought it was good that they did not put all the exercises on the full calendar, but this was different. If it is my favorites page, shouldn't each day where my favorite group exercise was scheduled have some sort of indicator on the days where my favorite group exercise was planning to have their sessions? I feel like that is something that should be implemented into the favorites section to make it easier for the user to find their group exercises sessions.
		
    Now that I found a way to find the yoga classes and then add them to my favorite classes, my goal was complete. I was able to mark yoga on my favorite classes, and now I can easily find yoga group exercises for any given day. The WREC application was very **learnable** in the sense that I was able to figure out how to use it very easily and very quickly. Having me add the yoga group exercises to my favorite classes was very **efficient** and did not consume much time. The efficiency did not only come from how quickly and effortlessly in finding the yoga group exercises page, but also after adding it as a favorite it is extremely easy to find another yoga class. Making it a long-lasting feature that will help me for months to come. I have found the WREC app to be very **useful** with minimal and minor flaws. One of the only problems I had with the application was finding my favorite classes right after adding yoga to my favorite classes. If they could give an explanation about how to reach favorite classes after adding a group exercise, then this application would be more **error tolerant**. This means that the user would not make as many errors that could waste the userâ€™s time. Clear feedback would be beneficial. I would expect the WREC application to be very **memorable** as the main page really runs the entire application. This means it should be easy to remember how to use the application. The WREC application was quite easy to use, and it was fast at helping me get my beloved yoga class into a calendar where I could see what times they are at.
