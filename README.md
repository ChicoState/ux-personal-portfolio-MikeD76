# UX Portfolio

Hi! My name is Michael Davis but I prefer Mike. I was a transfer last year from Butte College and am now taking my 3rd term at Chico State. On my free time I like to play videogames, take my dog on adventures, go indoor rock climbing, lifting weights, reading books, hanging out with my friends and doing all of the previous with my girlfriend as well. My favorite book is The Name of the Wind. I love a variety of different musical genres as well. I enjoy all of my Computer Science classes and I'm excited to get this term started!
