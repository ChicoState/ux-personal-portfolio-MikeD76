Hi! My name is Michael Davis but I prefer Mike. I was a transfer last year from Butte College and am now taking my 3rd term at Chico State. On my free time I like to play videogames, take my dog on adventures, go indoor rock climbing, lifting weights, reading books, and hanging out with my friends. The best part is that I have an amazing girlfriend that I get to do all of my favorite things with. My favorite book is The Name of the Wind. I love a variety of different musical genres as well. I enjoy all of my Computer Science classes and I'm excited to get this term started!
